# Biography

Ernest Lee is a 6th year M.D./Ph.D. student in the UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program and a 4th year graduate student in the Department of Bioengineering at UCLA under Dr. Gerard Wong. He received a B.S. in Physics with Honors from Caltech in 2012. He is interested in conducting research at the intersection of infectious, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on machine-learning aided design of membrane-active antimicrobial peptides, anti-inflammatory strategies for autoimmune diseases, and the role of the nervous system in innate immune defense. He is a recipient of a 2017-2018 Early Career Research Grant from the National Psoriasis Foundation, a 2017-2018 NIAMS T32 Dermatology Scientist Training Program Grant, and a 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 NIGMS T32 Systems and Integrative Biology Training Program Grant.
