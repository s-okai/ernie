# Biography

I am currently a research-track dermatology resident at [UCSF](http://www.dermatology.ucsf.edu). I am a physician-scientist in dermatology who has trained in soft matter physics, structural and computational biology, immunology, and microbiology. I am interested in leveraging multidisciplinary strategies to study scientific questions at the intersection of infectious and autoimmune skin diseases. My graduate work spanned machine-learning aided design of membrane-active antimicrobial peptides, molecular mechanisms of psoriasis, lupus, and scleroderma, and the role of the nervous system in host defense against systemic infection. I graduated with an MD from the [UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program](http://mstp.healthsciences.ucla.edu/students/ernest-lee-phd) in 2020, and completed my PhD in Bioengineering in 2018 under the mentorship of [Dr. Gerard C.L. Wong](http://wonglab.seas.ucla.edu). I received a BS in Physics with Honors from Caltech in 2012. I am a member of AÎ©A, Tau Beta Pi, and Sigma Xi, and recipient of an [Early Career Research Grant](https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.100073805) from the [National Psoriasis Foundation](https://www.psoriasis.org), the Emil Bogen Research Prize, and the Edward K. Rice Outstanding Doctoral Student Award. In my spare time, I love discovering new restaurants, solving Rubik's cubes, and rooting for the Lakers.
