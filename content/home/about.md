# Biography

I am a 6th year M.D./Ph.D. student in the [UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program](http://mstp.healthsciences.ucla.edu/students/ernest-lee) and a 4th year graduate student in the Department of Bioengineering at UCLA under [Dr. Gerard Wong](http://wonglab.seas.ucla.edu). I received a B.S. in Physics with Honors from Caltech in 2012. I am interested in conducting research at the intersection of infectious, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on machine-learning aided design of membrane-active antimicrobial peptides, anti-inflammatory strategies for autoimmune diseases, and the role of the nervous system in innate immune defense. I am a recipient of a 2017-2018 [Early Career Research Grant](https://grants.uberresearch.com/100003185/NPF2017ECRG02/NETs-generate-immune-complexes-to-amplify-TLR9-based-inflammation-in-psoriasis) from the [National Psoriasis Foundation](https://www.psoriasis.org), a 2017-2018 NIAMS T32 Dermatology Scientist Training Program Grant, and a 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 NIGMS T32 Systems and Integrative Biology Training Program Grant.
