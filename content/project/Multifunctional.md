We use bioinformatics and machine learning to decompose how amino acid sequences can encode multiple functions in the same protein. These span antimicrobial peptides, cytokines, apoptosis regulators, bacterial secretion systems, and other membrane-remodeling proteins (Lee et al. ACS Central Science 2017, Lee et al. Bioconjugate Chemistry 2018, Lee et al. Curr. Opin. Coll. Int. Sci. 2018, Silvestre-Roig et al. Nature 2019).
