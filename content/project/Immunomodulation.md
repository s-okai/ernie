We combine state of the art X-ray measurements with computer simulations and immune cell measurements to delineate structural design principles for molecules that modulate of Toll-like receptor signaling. Of particular interest are electrostatically self-assembled antimicrobial peptide-nucleic acid nanocrystals that amplify inflammation in autoimmune disease.
