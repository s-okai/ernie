abstract = "We examine how the interferon production of plasmacytoid dendritic cells is amplified by the self-assembly of liquid-crystalline antimicrobial peptide/DNA complexes. These specialized dendritic cells are important for host defense because they quickly release large quantities of type I interferons in response to infection. However, their aberrant activation is also correlated with autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and lupus. In this review, we will describe how polyelectrolyte self-assembly and the statistical mechanics of multivalent interactions contribute to this process. In a more general compass, we provide an interesting conceptual corrective to the common notion in molecular biology of a dichotomy between specific interactions and non-specific interactions, and show examples where one can construct exquisitely specific interactions using non-specific interactions."
