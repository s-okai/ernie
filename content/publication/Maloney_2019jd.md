abstract = "Purpose: Apremilast is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor FDA approved for psoriatic arthritis and moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. In recent years, multiple studies have suggested other potential uses for apremilast in dermatology. A summary of these various studies will be a valuable aid to dermatologists considering apremilast for an alternative indication. Materials and Methods: The PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were queried with the term 'apremilast', with results manually screened to identify published data on off-label uses of apremilast. Results from case reports and case series on a specific disease were omitted if randomized controlled data on that disease was available. The article was structured by the quality of evidence available. Results: Apremilast use in dermatology beyond plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is well described in the literature, with a mixture of positive and negative results. Randomized controlled data is available for Behçet’s disease, hidradenitis suppurativa, nail/scalp/palmoplantar psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis.  Conclusion: The relatively safe adverse effect profile of apremilast and its broad immunomodulatory characteristics may make it a promising option in the future for patients with difficult to treat diseases in dermatology, refractory to first line therapies, but further studies will be necessary to clarify its role."
