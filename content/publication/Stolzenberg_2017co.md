abstract = "BACKGROUND:Alpha-synuclein (\u03b1S) is a nerve cell protein associated with Parkinson disease (PD). Accumulation of \u03b1S within the enteric nervous system (ENS) and its traffic from the gut to the brain are implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of PD. \u03b1S has no known function in humans and the reason for its accumulation within the ENS is unknown. Several recent studies conducted in rodents have linked \u03b1S to immune cell activation in the central nervous system. We hypothesized that \u03b1S in the ENS might play a role in the innate immune defenses of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n\nMETHODS:We immunostained endoscopic biopsies for \u03b1S from children with documented gastric and duodenal inflammation and intestinal allograft recipients who contracted norovirus. To determine whether \u03b1S exhibited immune-modulatory activity, we examined whether human \u03b1S induced leukocyte migration and dendritic cell maturation.\n\nFINDINGS:We showed that the expression of \u03b1S in the enteric neurites of the upper GI tract of pediatric patients positively correlated with the degree of acute and chronic inflammation in the intestinal wall. In intestinal allograft subjects who were closely monitored for infection, expression of \u03b1S was induced during norovirus infection. We also demonstrated that both monomeric and oligomeric \u03b1S have potent chemoattractant activity, causing the migration of neutrophils and monocytes dependent on the presence of the integrin subunit, CD11b, and that both forms of \u03b1S stimulate dendritic cell maturation.\n\nINTERPRETATION:These findings strongly suggest that \u03b1S is expressed within the human ENS to direct intestinal inflammation and implicates common GI infections in the pathogenesis of PD."
