abstract = "**Introduction:** The advent of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment. Over seven immunotherapy drugs have already been FDA approved with multiple indications, and countless more are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials. However, clinical response to immunotherapies is highly heterogeneous among individual patients and between cancer types. This represents a challenge to oncologists when choosing specific immunotherapies for personalized medicine. As a result, the abilities to predict tumor responsiveness to immunotherapies before initiation of treatment and monitor tumor susceptibility during treatment are extremely valuable. **Areas covered:** Here, we review the latest advances in biomarker-based noninvasive prediction and in-treatment monitoring of tumor response to immunotherapy, focusing primarily on circulating markers for melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, with discussion of other tumor types. We concentrate on high quality studies published within the last five years on checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Finally, we highlight significant breakthroughs, identify key areas for improvement, and provide recommendations for how these diagnostic tools can be translated into clinical practice. **Expert commentary:** The first biomarkers proposed to predict treatment response to cancer immunotherapy were based on PD1 and PDL1 expression, but their predictive value seems to be limited to specific cancers or patient populations. Recent advances in single-cell molecular profiling of circulating tumor cells and host cells using next-generation sequencing techniques has dramatically expanded the pool of potentially useful predictive biomarkers. As immunotherapy moves towards personalized medicine, it is likely that a composite panel of both genomic and proteomic biomarkers, which reflect dynamic changes in the tumor microenvironment and host immunology, will have enormous utility in directing therapeutic decision-making."
