abstract = "With the explosion of “big data” in medicine driven by the advent of electronic medical records, next-generation sequencing and “multi-omics”, and non-invasive imaging techniques, dermatology is a field at the precipice of an artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Yet to the majority of clinicians, machine learning (ML) is a magical “black box” that is powerful but inaccessible. Here, we review the latest advances in machine learning applied to dermatological diagnosis and treatment and highlight key discoveries with translational potential."
