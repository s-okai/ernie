abstract = "A common bioengineering strategy to add function to a given molecule is by conjugation of a new moiety onto that molecule. Adding multiple functions in this way becomes increasingly challenging and leads to composite molecules with larger molecular weights. In this review, we attempt to gain a new perspective by looking at this problem in reverse, by examining natureâ€™s strategies of multiplexing different functions into the same pleiotropic molecule using emerging analysis techniques such as machine learning. We concentrate on examples from the innate immune system, which employs a finite repertoire of molecules for a broad range of tasks. An improved understanding of how diverse functions are multiplexed into a single molecule can inspire new approaches for deterministic design of multifunctional molecules."
