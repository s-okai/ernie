abstract = {Oxidation is associated with conditions related to chronic inflammations and aging. Cubic structures have been observed in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial membranes of cells under oxidative stress (e.g., tumor cells and virus-infected cells). It has been previously suspected that oxidation can result in the rearrangement of lipids from a fluid lamellar phase to a cubic structure in organelles containing membranes enriched with amphiphiles that have nonzero intrinsic curvature, such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and cardiolipin. This study focuses on the oxidation of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), a lipid that natively forms an inverted hexagonal phase at physiological conditions. The oxidized samples contain an approximately 3:2 molar ratio of nonoxidized to oxidized DOPE. Optical microscopy images collected during the hydration of this mixture from a dried film suggest that the system evolves into a coexistence of a stable fluid lamellar phase and transient square lattice structures with unit cell sizes of 500-600 nm. Small-angle X-ray scattering of the same lipid mixture yielded a body-centered Im3m cubic phase with the lattice parameter of 14.04 nm. On average, the effective packing parameter of the oxidized DOPE species was estimated to be 0.657 {\textpm} 0.069 (standard deviation). This suggests that the oxidation of PE leads to a group of species with inverted molecular intrinsic curvature. Oxidation can create amphiphilic subpopulations that potently impact the integrity of the membrane, since negative Gaussian curvature intrinsic to cubic phases can enable membrane destabilization processes.},

abstract = {We examine how the interferon production of plasmacytoid dendritic cells is amplified by the self-assembly of liquid-crystalline antimicrobial peptide/DNA complexes. These specialized dendritic cells are important for host defense because they quickly release large quantities of type I interferons in response to infection. However, their aberrant activation is also correlated with autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and lupus. In this review, we will describe how polyelectrolyte self-assembly and the statistical mechanics of multivalent interactions contribute to this process. In a more general compass, we provide an interesting conceptual corrective to the common notion in molecular biology of a dichotomy between specific interactions and non-specific interactions, and show examples where one can construct exquisitely specific interactions using non-specific interactions.},

abstract = {There are some ∼1,100 known antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which permeabilize microbial membranes but have diverse sequences. Here, we develop a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier to investigate ⍺-helical AMPs and the interrelated nature of their functional commonality and sequence homology. SVM is used to search the undiscovered peptide sequence space and identify Pareto-optimal candidates that simultaneously maximize the distance $\sigma$ from the SVM hyperplane (thus maximize its "antimicrobialness") and its ⍺-helicity, but minimize mutational distance to known AMPs. By calibrating SVM machine learning results with killing assays and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we find that the SVM metric $\sigma$ correlates not with a peptide's minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), but rather its ability to generate negative Gaussian membrane curvature. This surprising result provides a topological basis for membrane activity common to AMPs. Moreover, we highlight an important distinction between the maximal recognizability of a sequence to a trained AMP classifier (its ability to generate membrane curvature) and its maximal antimicrobial efficacy. As mutational distances are increased from known AMPs, we find AMP-like sequences that are increasingly difficult for nature to discover via simple mutation. Using the sequence map as a discovery tool, we find a unexpectedly diverse taxonomy of sequences that are just as membrane-active as known AMPs, but with a broad range of primary functions distinct from AMP functions, including endogenous neuropeptides, viral fusion proteins, topogenic peptides, and amyloids. The SVM classifier is useful as a general detector of membrane activity in peptide sequences.},

abstract = {Triggering antimicrobial mechanisms in macrophages infected with intracellular pathogens, such as mycobacteria, is critical to host defense against the infection. To uncover the unique and shared antimicrobial networks induced by the innate and adaptive immune systems, gene expression profiles generated by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) from human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) activated with TLR2/1 ligand (TLR2/1L) or IFN-$\gamma$ were analyzed. Weighed gene correlation network analysis identified modules of genes strongly correlated with TLR2/1L or IFN-$\gamma$ that were linked by the "defense response" gene ontology term. The common TLR2/1L and IFN-$\gamma$ inducible human macrophage host defense network contained 16 antimicrobial response genes, including S100A12, which was one of the most highly induced genes by TLR2/1L. There is limited information on the role of S100A12 in infectious disease, leading us to test the hypothesis that S100A12 contributes to host defense against mycobacterial infection in humans. We show that S100A12 is sufficient to directly kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae. We also demonstrate that S100A12 is required for TLR2/1L and IFN-$\gamma$ induced antimicrobial activity against M. leprae in infected macrophages. At the site of disease in leprosy, we found that S100A12 was more strongly expressed in skin lesions from tuberculoid leprosy (T-lep), the self-limiting form of the disease, compared to lepromatous leprosy (L-lep), the progressive form of the disease. These data suggest that S100A12 is part of an innate and adaptive inducible antimicrobial network that contributes to host defense against mycobacteria in infected macrophages.},

abstract = {Type I IFNs are a cytokine family essential for antiviral defense. More recently, type I IFNs were shown to be important during bacterial infections. In this article, we show that, in addition to known cytokine functions, IFN-$\beta$ is antimicrobial. Parts of the IFN-$\beta$ molecular surface (especially helix 4) are cationic and amphipathic, both classic characteristics of antimicrobial peptides, and we observed that IFN-$\beta$ can directly kill Staphylococcus aureus Further, a mutant S. aureus that is more sensitive to antimicrobial peptides was killed more efficiently by IFN-$\beta$ than was the wild-type S. aureus, and immunoblotting showed that IFN-$\beta$ interacts with the bacterial cell surface. To determine whether specific parts of IFN-$\beta$ are antimicrobial, we synthesized IFN-$\beta$ helix 4 and found that it is sufficient to permeate model prokaryotic membranes using synchrotron x-ray diffraction and that it is sufficient to kill S. aureus These results suggest that, in addition to its well-known signaling activity, IFN-$\beta$ may be directly antimicrobial and be part of a growing family of cytokines and chemokines, called kinocidins, that also have antimicrobial properties.},

abstract = {Bacterial biofilms are associated with numerous human infections. The predominant protein expressed in enteric biofilms is the amyloid curli, which forms highly immunogenic complexes with DNA. Infection with curli-expressing bacteria or systemic exposure to purified curli-DNA complexes triggers autoimmunity via the generation of type I interferons (IFNs) and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies. Here, we show that DNA complexed with amyloid curli powerfully stimulates Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) through a two-step mechanism. First, the cross beta-sheet structure of curli is bound by cell-surface Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), enabling internalization of the complex into endosomes. After internalization, the curli-DNA immune complex binds strongly to endosomal TLR9, inducing production of type I IFNs. Analysis of wild-type and TLR2-deficient macrophages showed that TLR2 is the major receptor that drives the internalization of curli-DNA complexes. Suppression of TLR2 internalization via endocytosis inhibitors led to a significant decrease in Ifn$\beta$ expression. Confocal microscopy analysis confirmed that the TLR2-bound curli was required for shuttling of DNA to endosomal TLR9. Structural analysis using small-angle X-ray scattering revealed that incorporation of DNA into curli fibrils resulted in the formation of ordered curli-DNA immune complexes. Curli organizes parallel, double-stranded DNA rods at an inter-DNA spacing that matches up well with the steric size of TLR9. We also found that production of anti-double-stranded DNA autoantibodies in response to curli-DNA was attenuated in TLR2- and TLR9-deficient mice and in mice deficient in both TLR2 and TLR9 compared to wild-type mice, suggesting that both innate immune receptors are critical for shaping the autoimmune adaptive immune response. We also detected significantly lower levels of interferon-stimulated gene expression in response to purified curli-DNA in TLR2 and TLR9 deficient mice compared to wild-type mice, confirming that TLR2 and TLR9 are required for the induction of type I IFNs. Finally, we showed that curli-DNA complexes, but not cellulose, were responsible elicitation of the immune responses to bacterial biofilms. This study defines the series of events that lead to the severe pro-autoimmune effects of amyloid-expressing bacteria and suggest a mechanism by which amyloid curli acts as a carrier to break immune tolerance to DNA, leading to the activation of TLR9, production of type I IFNs, and subsequent production of autoantibodies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Alpha-synuclein ($\alpha$S) is a nerve cell protein associated with Parkinson disease (PD). Accumulation of $\alpha$S within the enteric nervous system (ENS) and its traffic from the gut to the brain are implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of PD. $\alpha$S has no known function in humans and the reason for its accumulation within the ENS is unknown. Several recent studies conducted in rodents have linked $\alpha$S to immune cell activation in the central nervous system. We hypothesized that $\alpha$S in the ENS might play a role in the innate immune defenses of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

METHODS:We immunostained endoscopic biopsies for $\alpha$S from children with documented gastric and duodenal inflammation and intestinal allograft recipients who contracted norovirus. To determine whether $\alpha$S exhibited immune-modulatory activity, we examined whether human $\alpha$S induced leukocyte migration and dendritic cell maturation.

FINDINGS:We showed that the expression of $\alpha$S in the enteric neurites of the upper GI tract of pediatric patients positively correlated with the degree of acute and chronic inflammation in the intestinal wall. In intestinal allograft subjects who were closely monitored for infection, expression of $\alpha$S was induced during norovirus infection. We also demonstrated that both monomeric and oligomeric $\alpha$S have potent chemoattractant activity, causing the migration of neutrophils and monocytes dependent on the presence of the integrin subunit, CD11b, and that both forms of $\alpha$S stimulate dendritic cell maturation.

INTERPRETATION:These findings strongly suggest that $\alpha$S is expressed within the human ENS to direct intestinal inflammation and implicates common GI infections in the pathogenesis of PD.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides are a class of membrane-active peptides that form a critical component of innate host immunity and possess a diversity of sequence and structure. Machine learning approaches have been profitably employed to efficiently screen sequence space and guide experiment towards promising candidates with high putative activity. In this mini-review, we provide an introduction to antimicrobial peptides and summarize recent advances in machine learning-enabled antimicrobial peptide discovery and design with a focus on a recent work Lee et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2016;113(48):13588-13593. This study reports the development of a support vector machine classifier to aid in the design of membrane active peptides. We use this model to discover membrane activity as a multiplexed function in diverse peptide families and provide interpretable understanding of the physicochemical properties and mechanisms governing membrane activity. Experimental validation of the classifier reveals it to have learned membrane activity as a unifying signature of antimicrobial peptides with diverse modes of action. Some of the discriminating rules by which it performs classification are in line with existing "human learned" understanding, but it also unveils new previously unknown determinants and multidimensional couplings governing membrane activity. Integrating machine learning with targeted experimentation can guide both antimicrobial peptide discovery and design and new understanding of the properties and mechanisms underpinning their modes of action.},

abstract = {Bacteria exhibit surface motility modes that play pivotal roles in early-stage biofilm community development, such as type IV pili-driven "twitching" motility and flagellum-driven "spinning" and "swarming" motility. Appendage-driven motility is controlled by molecular motors, and analysis of surface motility behavior is complicated by its inherently 3D nature, the speed of which is too fast for confocal microscopy to capture. Here, we combine electromagnetic field computation and statistical image analysis to generate 3D movies close to a surface at 5 ms time resolution using conventional inverted microscopes. We treat each bacterial cell as a spherocylindrical lens and use finite element modeling to solve Maxwell's equations and compute the diffracted light intensities associated with different angular orientations of the bacterium relative to the surface. By performing cross-correlation calculations between measured 2D microscopy images and a library of computed light intensities, we demonstrate that near-surface 3D movies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa translational and rotational motion are possible at high temporal resolution. Comparison between computational reconstructions and detailed hydrodynamic calculations reveals that P. aeruginosa act like low Reynolds number spinning tops with unstable orbits, driven by a flagellum motor with a torque output of ∼2 pN $\mu$m. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that P. aeruginosa can undergo complex flagellum-driven dynamical behavior, including precession, nutation, and an unexpected taxonomy of surface motility mechanisms, including upright-spinning bacteria that diffuse laterally across the surface, and horizontal bacteria that follow helicoidal trajectories and exhibit superdiffusive movements parallel to the surface.},

abstract = {Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) by specific binding to endosomal Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3). Recently, it has been shown that hyperactivation of TLR3 in psoriatic keratinocytes by dsRNA can occur in the presence of human antimicrobial peptide (AMP) LL37. Here, we combine synchrotron X-ray scattering, microscopy, computer simulations, and measurements of NHEK cytokine production to elucidate a previously unanticipated form of specific molecular pattern recognition. LL37 and similar $\alpha$-helical AMPs can form pro-inflammatory nanocrystalline complexes with dsRNA that are recognized by TLR3 differently than dsRNA alone. dsRNA complexes that activate IL-6 production in NHEK and those that do not are both able to enter cells and co-localize with TLR3. However, the crystallinity of these AMP-dsRNA complexes, specifically the geometric spacing between parallel dsRNA and the repeat number of ordered dsRNA, strongly influences the level of TLR3 activation. Crystalline complexes that present dsRNA at a spacing that matches with the steric size of TLR3 can recruit and engage multiple TLR3 receptors, driving receptor clustering and immune amplification, whereas crystalline complexes that exhibit poor steric matching do not. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR of IL-6 during siRNA knockdown of TLR3 confirms that cytokine production is due to TLR3: High levels of IL-6 transcription are observed for sterically matched complexes without TLR3 knockdown, whereas such activity is abrogated with TLR3 knockdown.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse class of well-studied membrane-permeating peptides with important functions in innate host defense. In this short review, we provide a historical overview of AMPs, summarize previous applications of machine learning to AMPs, and discuss the results of our studies in the context of the latest AMP literature. Much work has been recently done in leveraging computational tools to design new AMP candidates with high therapeutic efficacies for drug-resistant infections. We show that machine learning on AMPs can be used to identify essential physico-chemical determinants of AMP functionality, and identify and design peptide sequences to generate membrane curvature. In a broader scope, we discuss the implications of our findings for the discovery of membrane-active peptides in general, and uncovering membrane activity in new and existing peptide taxonomies.},

abstract = {Dnm1 and Fis1 are prototypical proteins that regulate yeast mitochondrial morphology by controlling fission, the dysregulation of which can result in developmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Loss of Dnm1 blocks the formation of fission complexes and leads to elongated mitochondria in the form of interconnected networks, while overproduction of Dnm1 results in excessive mitochondrial fragmentation. In the current model, Dnm1 is essentially a GTP hydrolysis-driven molecular motor that self-assembles into ring-like oligomeric structures that encircle and pinch the outer mitochondrial membrane at sites of fission. In this work, we use machine learning and synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to investigate whether the motor Dnm1 can synergistically facilitate mitochondrial fission by membrane remodeling. A support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier trained to detect sequences with membrane-restructuring activity identifies a helical Dnm1 domain capable of generating negative Gaussian curvature (NGC), the type of saddle-shaped local surface curvature found on scission necks during fission events. Furthermore, this domain is highly conserved in Dnm1 homologues with fission activity. Synchrotron SAXS measurements reveal that Dnm1 restructures membranes into phases rich in NGC, and is capable of inducing a fission neck with a diameter of 12.6 nm. Through in silico mutational analysis, we find that the helical Dnm1 domain is locally optimized for membrane curvature generation, and phylogenetic analysis suggests that dynamin superfamily proteins that are close relatives of human dynamin Dyn1 have evolved the capacity to restructure membranes via the induction of curvature mitochondrial fission. In addition, we observe that Fis1, an adaptor protein, is able to inhibit the pro-fission membrane activity of Dnm1, which points to the antagonistic roles of the two proteins in the regulation of mitochondrial fission.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are typically thought of as molecular hole punchers that directly kill pathogens by membrane permeation. However, recent work has shown that AMPs are pleiotropic, multifunctional molecules that can strongly modulate immune responses. In this review, we provide a historical overview of the immunomodulatory properties of natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides, with a special focus on human cathelicidin and defensins. We also summarize the various mechanisms of AMP immune modulation and outline key structural rules underlying the recently-discovered phenomenon of AMP-mediated Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. In particular, we describe several complementary studies demonstrating how AMPs self-assemble with nucleic acids to form nanocrystalline complexes that amplify TLR-mediated inflammation. In a broader scope, we discuss how this new conceptual framework allows for the prediction of immunomodulatory behavior in AMPs, how the discovery of hidden antimicrobial activity in known immune signaling proteins can inform these predictions, and how these findings reshape our understanding of AMPs in normal host defense and autoimmune disease.},
